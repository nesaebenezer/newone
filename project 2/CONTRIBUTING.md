# Contributing to Crime Pattern Detection System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Crime Pattern Detection System! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this academic project.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project aims to demonstrate fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms concepts through a practical crime analysis application. Contributions should align with educational objectives while maintaining code quality.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Basic understanding of DSA concepts

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crime-pattern-detection.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new frontend code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add comments for complex algorithms
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)

### DSA Implementation Standards
